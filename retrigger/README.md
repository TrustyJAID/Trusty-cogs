# How to use ReTrigger

ReTrigger is a highly versatile cog that allows server moderators and administrators to automatically perform many tasks based on regular expressions (regex) in chat. https://regex101.com/ Is suggested to test out any regular expression patterns you want before adding to the bot. Some commonly used tools include:

 - `\b` meaning word boundaries usually used at the beginning and end of the word or sentence to avoid triggering on `testing` when you only want `test`. (e.g. regex of `\bhello, world\b` will __only__ trigger if someone says exactly `hello, world` and not `hello, worlds`.)
 - `(?i)` at the beginning of the regex will ignore cases in the search so `test`, `Test`, and `TEST` are treated the same.
 - **Groups** can be utilized to pick specific parts of the pattern to be used later. Groups look like `(^I wanna be )([^.]*)` where everything inside the `()` brackets are a group. Groups are numbered 0 and up where 0 is the full pattern, 1 would be `I wanna be` and 2 would be `[^.]*]`. In this example anything after the words `I wanna be` is captured and can then be used in the response of the trigger by using `{2}` to signify group 2.
 - More useful special characters:
    - `^` signifies the start of a string.
    - `$` signifies the end of a string.
    - `?` 0 or 1 of the previous character or group.
    - `+` 1 or more of the previous character or group.
    - `*` 0 or more of the previous character or group.
    - `.` any character other than newline.
    - `|` **or** statement meaning this **or** that.

Special replacement parameters are as follows:
- `{p}` can be used to replace the bots default prefix in the message.
- `{pp}` can be used to list all the bots prefixes available on the server.
- `{count}` can be used to show the number of times a trigger has been triggered.
- `{nummatch}` can be used to replace the number of matches the pattern found.
- `{lenmessage}` can be used to replace the length of the message.
- `{lenmatch}` can be used to replace the length of the largest match found.



## Basic Commands

- ▶ will display the next trigger in the list
- ◀ will display the previous trigger in the list
- ⏭ will jump to the last trigger in the list
- ⏮ will jump to the first trigger in the list
- ⏯ will toggle the displayed triggers active setting
- ❎ will toggle the displayed trigger to be not active
- ✅ will toggle the displayed trigger to be active

### **remove**
__Usage:__ `[p]retrigger remove <trigger>`
- `<trigger>` is the name of the trigger you want to delete.
This will delete a trigger.

### **cooldown**
__Usage:__ `[p]retrigger cooldown <trigger> <time> [style=guild]`
Set cooldown options for specified triggers. This can be used to ensure a trigger is not constantly spammed by giving some time until it is allowed to be triggered again. Time must be in seconds.

### **blacklist**
Set blacklist options for specified triggers.
Blacklist will ensure **everyone except** the objects added to the trigger blacklist will trigger. For example if you blacklist a role for the trigger anyone with that role will **not** trigger it. This can be useful for removing select bad actors from spamming specific triggers over and over. **Note:** If a whitelist is present on the trigger anything in the blacklist is ignored.
 - **add** Add a channel, user, or role to a triggers blacklist.
  __Usage:__ `[p]retrigger blacklist add <trigger> [channel_user_role...]`
 	multiple channels, users, or roles can be added at the same time.
 - **remove** Remove a channel, user, or role from a triggers blacklist.
  __Usage:__ `[p]retrigger blacklist remove <trigger> [channel_user_role...]`
 	multiple channels, users, or roles can be added at the same time.

### **whitelist**
Set whitelist options for specified triggers.
Whitelist will ensure **only** the objects added to the trigger whitelist will actually trigger. For example if you whitelist a role for the trigger only users with that role can actually trigger it. This can be useful for setting specific triggers to only occur in a specified channel and help with automatic moderation of specific channels/users/roles.
 - **add** Add a channel, user, or role to a triggers whitelist.
 __Usage:__ `[p]retrigger whitelist add <trigger> [channel_user_role...]`
 	multiple channels, users, or roles can be added at the same time.

 - **regex** Edit the regex of a saved trigger.
 - **edited** Toggle whether the bot will listen to edited messages as well as `on_message` for the specified trigger.
 - **ignorecommands** Toggle the regex matching inside normally ignored command messages.
 - **ocr** Toggle whether to use Optical Character Recognition to search for text within images. **Requires `pytesseract-ocr` and [google tesseract]([https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)) be installed on the host machine.**

## F.A.Q.
__Can ReTrigger perform different actions if a user triggers it enough times?__
 - No. This is better suited for an entirely separate cog. This one is highly complex as it is and meant more as a versatile trigger system not automatic moderation although it can still be used as an automatic moderation tool.

__Can ReTrigger warn a user automatically?__
 - Yes! Although there is a risk involved in allowing this, as such it's hidden by normal usage. What you want to do is `[p] retrigger mock` which will then perform the same function as the `command` trigger but rather than run the command as the user who sent the message it runs the command as the user who *created* the trigger. Meaning that it's possible to supply someone full bot access if you're not careful with how you handle this and one could even force shutoff the bot. So be careful but the utility is there.

 __Can ReTrigger read the headers of files uploaded to see if they're malicious?__
  - No. This is something discord already handles for the most part and if it's an issue you have on a regular basis ensure you're reporting to discord. If you were looking instead to read the text inside an image for bad words that *is* do-able now through Optical Character Recognition support requiring that `pytesseract-ocr` and [google tesseract]([https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)) are installed on the host machine. Then your trigger needs to have OCR toggled on.

__ReTrigger seems to be taking up a lot of ram, is this normal?__
 - Unfortunately yes it is. In order to allow *safe* regular expression searches with full features and not let bad users input a regex pattern that will take minutes-hours to fully search due to regression the cog utilizes multiprocessing which increases the memory usage. I would recommend adding more SWAP memory to alleviate some of these issues if you're tight on ram.

 __ReTrigger filter isn't working for me!__
  - Most likely the people you have testing it have Manage Messages permission. This was done because people with that permission are more than likely trusted not to post things they shouldn't be and they have the power to remove those messages from other people. No there's no way to bypass this, they're immune as an extra layer of protection alongside people with ban members permission so that people can't ban themselves or supply themselves roles they're not supposed to. Last thing you want is to accidentally ban someone for something silly like a bot function.

__ReTrigger stopped responding to one of my triggers, HALP!__
 - That's not a question? Anyways please share full details and tracebacks in my channel in the cog server. I suspect the issue might be that you ran out of memory and the trigger took too long to respond which will automatically kick out the trigger assuming it was poorly structured regex. Reloading the cog should fix this but if you're still having issues and increasing your SWAP space did not help you might look at `[p]retrigger bypass` which will allow you to disable the safe regex searching in servers you fully trust the mod team to not try and crash your bot.

 __Regex is hard, couldn't you just do a normal trigger option?__
  - I fully understand the learning curve of regex. When I started this cog I had no idea how to use regular expressions. That said I knew of its power and I hope by puting this cog out there more people can learn of its versatility. The tools are there and likely a lot easier than you might think. Play around with it and have fun!
