## Works in Progress
*These Cogs are a work in progress and have limited to no functionality at the moment. Feel free to leave ideas or suggestions!*

| Name | Status | Description (Click to see full status)
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anime | **Alpha**| <details><summary>A cog that gets what current anime episodes are airing and posts them on discord when they start airing.</summary> There was an update to the API being used and I need to rewrite for the new API.</details> |
| Halo | **Work in Progress**| Cogs for accessing information from the Halo video games API systems. |
| Chatterbot | **Alpha** | Teach your bot how to talk by watching conversations on servers and reply. Uses chatterbot library. NOTE: This cog is not recommended to be used at this time. After a month of usage it caused the whole bot to slow down while it searched for responses. I recommend looking at cleverbot for the time being. |


## Rewritten Cogs Originally Made by others 
*These cogs were originally written by others for V2. As they were used frequently on TrustyBot I ported them over quickly for V3. A better version may be available.*

| Welcome | **Beta**| Welcomes users to the server. |
